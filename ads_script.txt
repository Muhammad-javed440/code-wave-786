================================================================================
STEP 1: WHAT YOU NEED (Equipment & Software)
================================================================================

RECORDING TOOLS (all free):
  - Screen Recording:  OBS Studio (free, Windows/Mac)
                       OR ShareX (free, Windows — lighter)
                       OR Loom (free tier — easiest to start)
  - Phone Camera:      Any smartphone with 1080p video (for founder video)
  - Microphone:        Phone earbuds with mic work fine to start.
                       Upgrade later: any USB mic (under $20)

EDITING SOFTWARE (all free):
  - CapCut Desktop     — Best for beginners. Free. Has templates.
                         Perfect for Reels/Stories.
  - DaVinci Resolve    — Professional-grade. Free. Best for longer videos.
  - Canva Video        — Browser-based. Great for simple text animations.

MUSIC & SOUND (royalty-free):
  - Pixabay Music      — pixabay.com/music (100% free, no attribution)
  - Mixkit             — mixkit.co/free-stock-music (free)
  - YouTube Audio      — studio.youtube.com (free music library)
  - Search keywords:   "cinematic tech", "modern corporate", "upbeat digital"

FONTS (to match your brand):
  - Use bold, clean fonts: Inter, Poppins, or Montserrat (all free on Google Fonts)
  - Your website uses Tailwind defaults which pair with these


================================================================================
STEP 2: HOW TO RECORD SCREEN (Step-by-step)
================================================================================

USING OBS STUDIO:
  1. Download from obsproject.com and install
  2. Open OBS -> Click "+" under Sources -> "Display Capture"
  3. Set resolution: 1920x1080 (for feed videos) or 1080x1920 (for reels)
  4. Open your website in Chrome -> make it fullscreen (F11)
  5. Click "Start Recording" in OBS
  6. Slowly navigate through your website (don't rush — smooth movements)
  7. Click "Stop Recording" when done
  8. File saves to your Videos folder automatically

RECORDING TIPS:
  - Use a clean browser (no bookmarks bar, no extra tabs visible)
  - Clear browser cache so website loads fresh with animations
  - Move your mouse slowly and deliberately
  - Wait 1-2 seconds on each section before scrolling
  - Record MORE than you need — you'll cut it down in editing
  - Record each page separately (easier to edit later)

WHAT TO RECORD (checklist):
  [ ] Homepage loading with animations and floating orbs
  [ ] Stats counter animating from 0 to final numbers
  [ ] Hovering over the 3 feature cards (zoom effect)
  [ ] Chatbot opening, typing a message, getting response
  [ ] Chatbot voice input button tap
  [ ] Projects page scrolling through cards
  [ ] Hovering on dual-image cards (image swap effect)
  [ ] Clicking into a project detail page
  [ ] Star rating interaction (clicking stars)
  [ ] FAQ accordion expanding/collapsing
  [ ] Comment section — typing and submitting
  [ ] Like button click (heart animation)
  [ ] Image lightbox opening
  [ ] Signup page — filling the form and submitting
  [ ] Login page with "Forgot Password?" link
  [ ] About page — founder section, team members
  [ ] Contact page — email card, maps, WhatsApp card
  [ ] Contact form — location auto-detect button
  [ ] Dark/Light mode toggle (full theme switch)
  [ ] Mobile view (resize browser to phone size, or use phone)
  [ ] Admin dashboard (optional — charts, project management)


================================================================================
STEP 3: HOW TO RECORD FOUNDER VIDEO
================================================================================

SETUP:
  1. Find a clean, well-lit spot (near a window is best for natural light)
  2. Place your phone at eye level (stack books if needed)
  3. Use the front camera so you can see yourself
  4. Background: plain wall, bookshelf, or your computer setup
  5. Wear a solid color shirt (avoid stripes — they flicker on camera)

RECORDING:
  1. Open your phone camera app -> switch to Video -> 1080p
  2. Look directly at the camera lens (not the screen)
  3. Speak naturally, like you're talking to a friend
  4. Record the script in short sections (easier to edit)
  5. Do 2-3 takes of each section — pick the best one later
  6. Keep each take under 15 seconds for easy editing

SPEAKING TIPS:
  - Smile when you start talking
  - Speak slowly and clearly
  - Pause between sentences (helps in editing)
  - Use hand gestures (adds energy)
  - It's OK to read from a screen next to the camera (no one will notice)
  - Don't try to be perfect — authenticity beats polish


================================================================================
STEP 4: HOW TO EDIT (Using CapCut — Beginner Friendly)
================================================================================

BASIC EDIT WORKFLOW:
  1. Open CapCut Desktop (free download from capcut.com)
  2. Create new project -> 16:9 (for feed) or 9:16 (for reels)
  3. Import all your screen recordings and founder clips
  4. Drag clips to timeline in the order from the script
  5. Trim each clip to the exact duration noted in the script
  6. Add text overlays (use bold white text with black shadow)
  7. Add background music (lower volume to 15-20% if using voiceover)
  8. Add transitions between clips (use "Fade" or "Slide" — keep it simple)
  9. Export: 1080p, 30fps, MP4 format

TEXT STYLE GUIDE:
  - Font: Bold / Black weight
  - Color: White with a subtle black drop shadow
  - Size: Large enough to read on mobile
  - Position: Center or lower-third of screen
  - Animation: "Type In" or "Fade Up" (available in CapCut)

COLOR SCHEME (match your website):
  - Primary Orange:  #f97316
  - Red Accent:      #ef4444
  - Green Accent:    #22c55e
  - Background:      #000000 (dark) or #ffffff (light)
  - Text:            #ffffff on dark, #000000 on light


================================================================================
STEP 5: VIDEO FORMATS & SIZES
================================================================================

  FORMAT               RESOLUTION    RATIO    DURATION      USE FOR
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Facebook Feed        1920x1080     16:9     15-60 sec     Main video ads
  Facebook Stories     1080x1920     9:16     15 sec max    Story ads
  Instagram Feed       1080x1080     1:1      15-60 sec     Square feed posts
  Instagram Reels      1080x1920     9:16     15-30 sec     Reels / Stories
  YouTube              1920x1080     16:9     Any length    Demo / walkthrough
  WhatsApp Status      1080x1920     9:16     30 sec max    Status updates
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  TIP: Record in 16:9 (landscape). You can crop to 9:16 or 1:1 in CapCut.
       Or record in 9:16 from the start if your primary target is Reels.


================================================================================
STEP 6: EXPORT & UPLOAD CHECKLIST

  [ ] Make sure website URL is visible in the last 5 seconds

================================================================================
STEP 8: QUICK TIPS FOR BETTER RESULTS
================================================================================

  1. FIRST 3 SECONDS ARE EVERYTHING
     -> 65% of people skip ads in the first 3 seconds
     -> Start with a bold question, shocking stat, or fast visual
     -> Never start with your logo (nobody cares about logos yet)

  2. ADD CAPTIONS / SUBTITLES
     -> 85% of Facebook videos are watched on mute
     -> Use CapCut auto-captions (built-in feature)
     -> Bold white text with black outline = readable everywhere

  3. MOBILE FIRST
     -> 90%+ of your audience watches on phones
     -> Use large text, close-up shots, high contrast
     -> Test your video on YOUR phone before posting

  4. KEEP IT SHORT
     -> 15 seconds for Reels/Stories
     -> 30-60 seconds for feed ads
     -> Only go 90+ seconds for YouTube/demo videos

  5. ONE VIDEO = ONE MESSAGE
     -> Don't try to say everything in one video
     -> Video #1 = "What is Code Wave AI?"
     -> Video #3 = "Here's how the platform works"
     -> Video #5 = "Meet the founder"

  6. CALL TO ACTION EVERY TIME
     -> Every video must end with a clear CTA
     -> "Visit our website" / "Sign up free" / "Message us on WhatsApp"
     -> Show the URL on screen for at least 3-5 seconds

  7. POST CONSISTENTLY
     -> 3-4 times per week minimum
     -> Reels perform better than static images
     -> Best posting times for Pakistan: 8-10 PM (after work/school)

  8. USE YOUR OWN FACE
     -> Videos with faces get 30% more engagement
     -> The founder video (#5) will likely outperform all others
     -> People connect with people, not brands

  9. REPURPOSE CONTENT
     -> One 60-second video = four 15-second Reels
     -> Screen recordings can become multiple clips
     -> Every new project on your site = new content

  10. TRACK AND IMPROVE
      -> Check Facebook Ads Manager every 2-3 days
      -> Look at: Video Views, ThruPlay rate, CTR, Cost per result
      -> If CTR is below 1%, change the hook (first 3 seconds)
      -> If people watch but don't click, change the CTA
